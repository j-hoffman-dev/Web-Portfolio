To view this portfolio you'll need to first do some work, there are one of two ways to accomplish this;

METHOD 1:
<ol><li>enter the folder "public_html"</li>
</ol>

right click "index.html" and open with a browser (preferably chrome.)
enjoy!

METHOD 2:
1. Extract the .zip files contents to your desktop or other arbitrary location of your choosing.
2. import the WebDev folder generated into your favorite IDE.
3. Run the program- it doesnt require an internal web server or anything.
