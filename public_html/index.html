                    with C#, the aptly named "SNEK" game quickly gained notoriety among

                    planned to implement a second player, as well as a scoreboard to 
                    further promote a more competitive experience. Such features however 
                    were scrapped as I lacked the interest/time to further develop the

                    work ethic. Though certainly not my first experience collaborating

                <p>Some years ago, my dad suffered a sudden cardiac arrest at his job and

                <p><b>Oh boy, where to begin with this one?</b><br><br> In college I wrote a 
                    couple of game engines, but nothing this substantial. Typically small 
                    in scale, inefficient, and with little regard for maintainability. I 
                    wanted to build something <b>bigger</b>, <i>faster</i>, <u>better</u> 
                    in every way.

                <p>Having to contending with the shear scale of this program it soon 
                    became evident that I couldn't just write code without considering how 
                    it would (or wouldn't) interact with other parts of the engine. It 
                    demanded a new approach to how I program, it challenged me to change 
                    how I <i>thought</i> about code.
                    Major bottlenecks of previous engines had been the use of 
                    libraries like Java AWT and poor design practices. So I decided to 
                    instead utilize low level libraries like OpenGL and subsequently 
                    overhaul engine architecture to accommodate by brushing up on my 
                    computing theory- the difference between the two is like night and day.

                    within reason. There's still a lot of work to do but I'm eager to push
